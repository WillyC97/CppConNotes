# CppCon Notes

This a repo to hold various notes I've made from CppCon talks.

Primarily the repo contains notes from the various years of Back to Basics talks.

They are by no means as they're just notes that I've made for my
own understanding of various topics. I hope that as my experience and knowledge
grows, the notes will become more detailed, but for now they mainly consist of;
what I understood and what I thought was most relevant from each talk.

I would like to use [`cling`](https://github.com/root-project/cling) and [`x-cling`](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) to try to make the notes more interactive,
but currently arm macOS builds are not supported and that unfortunately is the platform
I work on, so for now they've been written in `markdown`.
